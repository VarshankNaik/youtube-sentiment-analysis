worst film ever made
tia
i love movies that end with a bang not with a bad joke.
they should of had an aileen wuornos type character who feels sorry for joker, takes him under her wing, and gets him to help her get rid of the bodies.
damn.. sure glad i didn&#39;t watch the trailer before i watched the movie. i was disappointed but had i watched the trailer first i&#39;d be pissed. the trailer is a banger, pity the movie wasn&#39;t...
absolute a impressive work<br>both movie and music<br>&#39;&#39;tha&#39;s life&#39;
it was waste of money
i was so excited for this movie to come out but now no one wants to see it with me, a friend in my friend group saw it and told us all that it was the biggest waste of time. i just don&#39;t understand, why make it a musical??? the first one was brilliant, all they had to do was continue telling the story but they&#39;ve now thrown it all away trying something so stupid. i guess i won&#39;t be seeing how trash this is until its out netflix
man these trailers had us so hyped and now after the movie actually came out i find myself wishing that it hadn&#39;t and that we could&#39;ve just gone on thinking that this was gonna be good
i didn&#39;t have to look at it to know it was going to be brutal. if i want ti listen to music i will put on spotify. <br>it&#39;s a movie i want to watch,not some silly musical.<br>the average joe could have told them before they shot it that it&#39;s not going to work out.
2 so bad
return margot robbie as harley quin
i give it two dumbs down
decent film but to long and may not hit to most audiences who enjoy that first film. wait till it comes out on a streaming service
awful movie, more of a musical(lady gaga,) did nothing but sing, timeline was all wrong and the ending was sooooo stupid, save your dollars
there is great movie in joker 2 and it&#39;s this trailer because everything else needs to be cut.

the ending was quite the 180 from what i was expecting was going to happen. not a predictable film at all.
im already bored out my mind
i&#39;ll never see it. not after what i&#39;ve heard about it.
they missed the sequal so harddd... it could have been joker escaped from gotham&#39;s asylum with harley quinn help, but gets tracked down by batman in the abandoned chemical plants, he tripped and went into for a chemical bath, brought back to gotham&#39;s asylum but his mind is transform to 100% into the joker this time, since its no longer make-up.<br><br>the 1st movie bringing attention to mental health issues and the 2nd movie could have been wrong time, wrong place, and bad helps all around that really pushed arthur over the edge &quot;one bad day and it can really messed someone up forever&quot; type of quote from the joker anime movies.<br><br>the joker&#39;s origin could have been great similar to christian bale run as the batman with 3 movies: joker, bane, and catwoman appearances...
batman&#39;s pov what&#39;s wrong with you he is the villain, not a hero
when the trailer better than the movie xddddd
this movie is trash, trash, and more trash
very very very 250x very bad moviee 1/10
if i want to listen to music, i can go watch lala land .<br>i always start singing after 10 minutes. i am really angry and irritable. i think the director intentionally infected the audience with mental illness
it&#39;s very funny. they made the second one to mock and attack the fans of the first one but the joke is on you! hahaha
loved the movie, everyone gon think this a classic in 3-5 years.
we can&#39;t have anti government and anti system movie right warner bros ?
joker character destroyed
lady gaga destroyed the film...
this movie sucked
absolute garbage, i can&#39;t believe they&#39;d ruin such a great story by making it a musical
joker: fondles a lot of coxs.
i watched first movie 12 times only in theaters. if you share similar sentiment, trust me, skip this utter garbage,
they lure you in with the first one, then the sequels are just full of evil agendas and propaganda. classic satanic hollywood.
all of hollywood is peeeeedos. most are g ewish too. this phoenix guy is a g ew. you can guarantee he&#39;s been to diddy parties.
joaquin phoenix did the best he could&#39;ve done
it was just like a indian bolywood movies, only music, dancing and etc. such a great filming but poor job. i regret on my expectations from the first movie.
yang penting arthur fleck udah tobat
the is what happens when you let woke writers and lady gaga write garbage.
that looks like stefani germanotta.
am i the only one who actually really liked this movie (and found it a tiny bit relatable to an extent?)
too bad
i&#39;m going to sit this one out. i didn&#39;t enjoy the 1st one at all. while my opinion of the 1st one isn&#39;t a popular one, it seems the reviews on this one are brutal.
i knew the movie was going to be whacky, but i didn&#39;t expece the grape scene.
my favorite part of the movie was when i went home 34 minutes in
spend all their money on the movie, and realised they didnt have anything left for the warning labels, so they removed everything good and added music.
they turned the joker into a joke a musical way to mess up the joker
i liked the part when he said &quot;it&#39;s jokin time&quot; and joked this movie was good
this movie was made to make you forget about the joker.
this is the bad timeline
well for one, lady gaga is absolute trash. so theres that
what a shame. amazing actors. terrible terrible movie !
they did not, in fact, give the people what they want.
imo the movie is good but the way arthur died is just bad
losing hundreds of millions of $$$$$$    why turn this into a musical.  i will never see this.
i ain&#39;t gonne watch this movie. i go for terrifier 3!
miss the real harley, gaga sucks
joker: the edge of glory
loved it
super elegant and inteligent joker
warner bros pictures fantastic
should have called it joker 2, there was way too much lady gaga in the trailer, way too little joker. i didn&#39;t watch the movie because the trailer sucked.
looks horrific!
i don&#39;t know why there are so many criticisms, i think i understand the dynamics of the film, it makes you feel saturated, and a delirium, a saturation who suffers from mental illness is exactly that, arthur got fed up and spent his suffering in a musical....
i went to the cinema to watch it. i personally found it psychologically good, but my whole family cursed me out for choosing it
- dad: &quot;i&#39;m disappointed in you son&quot;<br>- dad after watching joker 2: &quot;i&#39;m so lucky to have you son&quot;
mckenna bypass
hahaaha what a woke fail...<br>an example of how you can ruin a great movie...<br>faaaail!!! hahajaaj
reminds me of someone&#39;s political campaign where all she does is cackle and scare everyone. haha
this movie doesn&#39;t exist
bollywood
i bet todd phillips knew even before the release that there will be backlash. (spoiler below)<br><br>when lee said, &quot;let&#39;s give the people what they want.&quot;, it was in arthur&#39;s fantasy. because that really was lee&#39;s mission in the film, - to empower the joker in arthur.; to fully convince arthur that he is the joker.  now, i get the gunshot in that particular scene. arthur already had the fear that he may anger lee if time comes, he&#39;ll decide not to give people what they want. <br><br>it was all intentional. todd did not give the people what they wanted for joker.  some angry, some disappointed, some just accepted it. good for me, i came to the theater with no expectations. though, i really don&#39;t mind the noise in social media right now about how bad this film is. some even hated it just because it&#39;s a &#39;musical&#39;, even though it&#39;s not really a musical film, considering the format. well, who am i to judge? art is subjective. what matters most is that - it has been said and done.  whether you love or hate joker 2, you get what you deserve.
well this looks stupid
joker : a <del>star</del> flop is born.
i was sad with the movie because i expected joker to be freed, he would have companions or a group of masked people and they would rob banks, but it was all just singing.
biggest flop of all time !
dc since 2023:<br>1 blue beetle <br>2 aquaman 2<br>3 shazam 2<br>4 the flash<br>-infinite joker 2 (cant even give it a rank)
to much fkn singing dog
hahn summit
as batman, i don&#39;t recommend this movie at all.
margot robbie is the best <br>and she dont cost 12 mill.
loved joker 1 , big batman fan and one of my favourite comics is the killing joke. is it worth seeing this one in cinema ? so many different reviews ?
this is the worst film i have ever watched. these were poorly written. i can&#39;t believe they destroy this character for good.
joke on you
woke bs
the 1st one was trash why would you waste time on a sequel
i have seen it twice so far. i love it. it&#39;s such a spectacle. i enjoyed it more the second time. sad more people didn&#39;t give it a chance.
its joking time
not wanting to be outdone by warner brothers/dc&#39;s joker 2, kevin fiege fast tracks, &quot;captain america: i can do this all day&quot; musical for broadway.
amazing cuts&amp;visuals&amp;camera works.<br>yet again joaquin&#39;s great acting here. todd phillips made a beautiful film.<br><br>i don&#39;t know how warnerbros came up with this sequel with musical ideas but it was just lack of story. <br><br>don&#39;t blame it to the working team!
the movie sucks bad
are people just hating on lady gaga for no reason or is the movie genuinely bad?
this trailer gave me hope.<br><br>the movie made me lose hope in holloywood.
dude were,s  my car and thennnnnnnn :)
me: mom i want to watch joker (joker 2019)<br>mom: but we have joker at home<br><br>joker at home:
thats disgusting.<br>how could they let down harley quinn with that nasty looking thing.<br>wheres the story?
wait is it a musical?
wtf this looks terrible why
still need time to mull it over but j&#39;ll say that the ending was very realistic.  that&#39;s probably what would have happened to a real joker in the real world.
these movies are too white. they need funny black people making fun of them.
did they printed wrongly on action ??? more like a musical to me....greatly disappointed!!!
what a horrible actress is gaga... like for real there&#39;s to much talent out there and they have to pick gaga to make this movie ???
they should remake it !
shame to creators of movie!!!!
they couldn&#39;t find a real lead actress? what is this?
jesus.
wb is heading down the same road as disney
watch tf one instead
the first movie sucked beyond understanding. what&#39;d they even consider a sequel for? i simply cannot understand doubling down on stupidity by making it a musical.  no shortage of re-re&#39;s in hollywood i guess.
i heard this movie was horrible.  say it isn&#39;t so!
audience to dc :- who wrote this shite some halfwit with a stutter?
boo
i heard that he gets raped straight into thinking he&#39;s not the joker lmao
where is the batmam ? joker always more hate batman cause of batman not laugh jokers joke
ya&#39;ll wernt ready for the &#39;j&#39;udgement day
3/10 <br>i would&#39;ve given a 5/10 if it wasn&#39;t for that trash ending
bad decision to hire ga ga<br>no depth in her <br>i dont know joachim compensates i guess
&quot;knock knock&quot;<br><br>&quot;who&#39;s there?&quot;<br><br>&quot;it&#39;s your investors wb, you just blew up a billion dollar franchise.&quot;
i felt second hand embarrassment while watching it. it really is excruciatingly bad
how to dig a grave for a strong superhero trademark and bury yourself deep, deep into that grave.<br>what has happened to superhero-movies the last years? is it supposed to be a statement somehow? horrible.
horrible movie waste of 200 million dollars why u gotta do this like it&#39;s high school musical lmao
fafo
joker 2: electric boogaloo
the signs were there<br>we just did not realize it
i was genuinely hurt by what happened right at the end of the movie. the last time i felt this way was when i finished watching berserk 1997.
conner harbors
i thought the first one sucked, the trailer tells me this will to
2024 is the year of bad trailers
what a joke
joker 2 : you&#39;re the clown.
dumb
the movie we didnt deserve and we didnt need
it is very unbelievable that this is one of the movies ever made. the cast, they played the characters. the cgi, i saw them. the soundtrack, i heard them. the scenes, the dialogue, they are included in the movie. for me, i think joker 2 is truly a movie that was made.
what a dumpster fire
one of the worst movies ive seen
jeramy dam
this looks amazing
i liked the movie... different strokes for different folks i guess.
lady ga ga is cute
i want 2 hours of my life back
the movie flopped
dc accidentally made a good live action movie with the first one so they had to go back and correct that with joker 2
waste of time this movie.
dang it. i really wanted to be good.
wtf is that?
wastes $250 million.<br>&quot;heh heh, i got you good chuds!&quot;
joker actor was good lady gaga was good however the movie story line just sucked. it was slow and had nothing going for it.
the music was fine. i liked the singing. it just didn&#39;t have anything to do with the story... or lack thereof.<br>basically this movie is just &quot;then this happens, then this happens, then this happens&quot;, but there was no real plot. just watching joker in court and the movie just ends. literally none of it mattered. i was surprised by this.
worst reimagining ever.
&quot;let&#39;s give the people what they want.&quot;  so much promise...  such a shame.  great teaser and trailer though.
coming back to this after watching do not watch this movie. its so bad. its more a musical than an actual joker movie.
health ledger is rolling in his grave.
if you havent seen it yet please save your money. this movie was horrible. turned it into musical play because of lady gaga. horrible horrible horrible movie. waste of money and time.
come on man! u should&#39;ve told me this was a musical!
some people get their kicks stomping on a dream
disappointed
i heard this movie was a disappointment
lixo.
maximillian points
just looks like nyc or la. visit any liberal city its pretty much gotham with the lunatics running the asylum.
33% on rotten tomatoes big oof
is it worth watching?
i thought this movie was phenomenal.
it&#39;s bad, it&#39;s a musical. no watch for me. nothing annoyes me as much as musicals. napoelon was bad too, this one i watch. beverly hills cop was bad and road house 2024 was bad. all bad, they can&#39;t make movies any more.
the worst and the most boring movie i have ever seen in a cinema
an abomination. my eyes.
my favorite part of this musical was when it ended i finally went home.
guys is this movie good
:) looks like he has a film:)
i am not watching it
just brilliant!!! lady gaga is great in this! didn&#39;t know she could act! and joachim is just awesome! see another oscar coming his way for this!!
when the trailer is better than the actual movie....
&quot;im gonna shove these f*cking games up your a**!&quot;<br><br>-avgn
the third world war is coming.<br>this is living proof..
finally- imho, a truly interesting take on the superhero movie.
why is everything now catering to histrionic former theatre kids?
a 200 million dollar hollywood movie was just beat at the box office by a 5 million (including marketing) dollar slasher splatter indie film starring a monochromatic clown who dresses up as santa claus and murders people with a chainsaw for christmas.<br><br>let that sink in. the era of the indie film has arrived.
i am so glad this garbage of a movie flop.
warner bros once again shows why they have become marvels little brother.
this movie is so awful
me to the critics: &quot;you wouldn&#39;t get it.&quot;-joker, 2019
hollywood is killing itself. it makes no sense. it&#39;s like they are purposely trying to lose everything they have. the notion of &quot;i&#39;m too big to fail&quot; applies to nothing! including hollywood.
total flop
what a crappy movie, what is this musical garbage??? wow amazing how you ruined this, there should never been a 2nd part at least not like this one, waste of time and money this was
this film looked so good from the trailer.
i like some of the gaga songs
stewie would say: &quot;the film is ruined, it&#39;s ruined...&quot;
terrifier 3 &gt; joker 2
like i said, deadpool &amp; wolverine gave marvel fans hope !  this movie destroyed dc fans  dreams !
gaga : joker face
it&#39;s amazing how you can waste the talent of joaqin phoenix on garbage like this
destroyed the legacy of the first imo
my favorite part was when the prison guards repeatedly lent their funny bones to jonkler when he was out of jokes, truly a touching scene.
the next part better be good.
wish i knew it is a musical before i got the tickets, completely different to the first part, and not in the best way sadly
apparently batman did a solo tap dancing number but it didn&#39;t make the final cut...
i loved it
a perfect example of the audience getting trolled.
something literally nobody asked for. a musical about the joker as a sequel to one of the best recent films.
horrible movie
where the new comments at?
y
you shouldn&#39;t have made a sequel. you basically ruined it.
what they don&#39;t tell you is its a damn musical.
i walked out halfway through; and i was on a plane.
guys , if you want better musical. i recommend wicked on november 22
